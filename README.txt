SFML SNAKE README

Just a "stream of conciousness" quickly bashed-out
implementation of Snake in C++ using SFML.

This was just a test to learn SFML back in the day,
and solve "Snake" in the most brute force fashion 
possible.

Simply "make" at the root directory of the files.
SHOULD statically compile to a larger binary with SFML.

Requirements: SFML 1.6, G++/GCC, maybe MinGW.
