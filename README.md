# SFML SNAKE README

## **Deprecated/ancient school project.**
----

## Compile Instructions

Simply type MAKE in a command window so long as the requirements are met.

----

A Windows binary is also included (Win32 IIRC).

Just a "stream of conciousness" quickly bashed-out implementation of Snake in C++ using SFML.

This was just a test to learn SFML back in the day, and solve "Snake" in the most brute force fashion possible.

Simply "make" at the root directory of the files.

It should statically compile to a larger binary with SFML.

----
## Requirements

SFML 1.6, G++/GCC, maybe MinGW.
